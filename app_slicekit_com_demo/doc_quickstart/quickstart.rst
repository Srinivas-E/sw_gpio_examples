sw_gpio_examples COM demo : Quick Start Guide
--------------------------------------------------

We use the XA-SK-GPIO GPIO Slice Card together with the xSOFTip UART software to create a UART , and send data to and from a PC COM port. 
Also xSOFTip I2C software component to communicate with on board ADC. 
This application showcases some of the software key features and serves as an example on how to use APIs of UART and I2C. 
This demo features UART data loop back, receives commands from comport, and perform according to the command input.

Software Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++

The following defines should be made according to the connection of the 
GPIO slice acard to the core board:

    * #define SK_GPIO_SLOT_SQUARE  - connect the GPIO slice card to the SLOT SQUARE of core baoard.
    * #define SK_GPIO_SLOT_CIRCLE  - connect the GPIO slice card to the SLOT CIRCLE of core baoard.
    * #define SK_GPIO_SLOT_TRIANGLE  - connect the GPIO slice card to the TRIANGLE of core baoard.
    * #define SK_GPIO_SLOT_STAR  - connect the GPIO slice card to the SLOT STAR of core baoard.
    
   #. Define AD7995_0 in module_i2c_master (#define AD7995_0)
	
Build the Application
+++++++++++++++++++++

The following components are required to build ``app_slicekit_com_demo`` application:
    
    * sc_i2c:  https://github.com/xcore/sc_i2c.git
    * sc_uart: https://github.com/xcore/sc_uart.git
    * xcommon: https://github.com/xcore/xcommon.git (Optional)

   #. Clone the above repositroes or download them as zipfile packages.
   #. Open the XDE (XMOS Development Tools - latest version as of this writing is 11.11.1) and Choose `File` |submenu| `Import`.
   #. Choose `General` |submenu| `Existing Projects into Workspace` and click **Next**.
   #. Click **Browse** next to `Select archive file` and select the first firmware ZIP file.
   #. Click **Finish**.
   #. Repeat the import process for the remaining zipfiles.
   #. To build, select `app_slicekit_com_demo` from `sw_gpio_examples` folder in the Project Explorer pane and click the **Build** icon.   

Install Demonstration Tools on the Host PC
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following tools should be installed on the host system in order to run this application

    * For Win 7: Hercules Setup Utility by HW-Group
      http://www.hw-group.com/products/hercules/index_en.html
    * For MAC users: SecureCRT7.0 
      http://www.vandyke.com/download/securecrt/
   
   #. Note: Make sure to change the settings of the tool as Windows style line end characters.

   Demonstration Hardware Setup

   #. Connect XA-SK-GPIO Slice Card to the XP-SKC-L2 Slicekit Core board. This Slice Card can be connected to either ``Square``, ``Tringle`` or ``Star`` connector of Slicekit Core board, but for now, use the TRIANGLE slot as shown in the figure above
   #. Connect COM port cable (provided with XA-SK-GPIO Slice Card package) to DB-9 connector on XA-SK-GPIO Slice Card.
   #. Connect other end of cable to Host (PC) DB-9 connector slot.
   #. Identify COM port number provided by the Host and open a suitable terminal software for the selected COM port (refer to the Hercules or SecureCRT documentation above) for default parameters which are as follows: 115200 baud, 8 bit character length, even parity config, 1 stop bit and no hardware flow control  
   #. Connect the XTAG Adapter to Slicekit Core board, Chain connector and connect XTAG-2 to the adapter. 
   #. Connect the XTAG-2 to host PC or Mac USB port.
   #. Switch on the power supply to the Slicekit Core board.

Use the Software
++++++++++++++++

   #. Open the XDE
   #. Choose *Run* |submenu| *Run Configurations*
   #. Double-click *XCore Application* to create a new configuration
   #. In the *Project* field, browse for `app_slicekit_com_demo`
   #. In the *C/C++ Application* field, browse for the compiled XE file
   #. Ensure the *XTAG-2* device is selected in the `Target:` adapter list
   #. Click **Run**

Do the Demo
+++++++++++

   #. Select and Open the configured terminal client application console
   #. WELCOME TO GPIO DEMO
	(**ECHO DATA MODE ACTIVATED**)
	Press '>cmd' for command mode
	In this mode Type in any character from the key board and application echoes back pressed keyed.
   #. Type in ``>cmd``for command mode.
   #. Type in ''help'' for list of supported commands.
   #. Type in ''setall'' for switching ON all the LEDs.
   #. Type in ''clearall'' for switching OFF all the LEDs.
   #. Type in ''setled N'' for switching ON a particular LED. 'N' ranges from 1 to 4.
   #. Type in ''clearled N'' for switching OFF a particular LED. 'N' ranges from 1 to 4.
   #. Type in ''chkbuttons'' for returning status of buttons since last 'chkbuttons' command.
   #. Type in ''readadc'' for readig ADC value and displaying current temperature.
   #. Type in ''exit'' for exiting command mode and go back to uart data echo mode.
